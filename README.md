# flyingsaucer

Flying Saucer is a pure-Java library for rendering arbitrary well-formed XML (or XHTML) using CSS
2.1 for layout and formatting, output to Swing panels, PDF, and images.

New releases of Flying Saucer are distributed through Maven. The available artifacts are:

* org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-core - Core library and Java2D rendering
* org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-pdf - PDF output using iText 2.x
* org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-pdf-itext5 - PDF output using iText 5.x
* org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-pdf-openpdf - PDF output using OpenPDF
* org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-swt - SWT output
* org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-log4j - Logging plugin for log4j

iText 2.x has unfixed security bugs. New projects should avoid it.
